    \item Experienced in C/C++, using standard Linux and Android libaries, STL and Qt
    \item Familiar with ARM assembly language, including ARMv4, ARMv5 and ARMv6 architectures and ARMv5e DSP instructions
    \item Familiar with use of version control systems including git, SVN and CVS
    \item Some experience in \LaTeX, HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, GNU Make, Perl, Tcl, SQL and Java
    \item Linux system admin with experience installing, configuring, managing and using Debian, Red Hat, Gentoo and Arch
    \item Seasoned computer user and programmer, able to quickly learn new tools, languages, libraries and techniques as needed to complete goals
\end{itemize}
\section{Experience}
\subsection{Open-Source Software Development}
\cventry{2010--current}{Volunteer Software Developer}{CyanogenMod}{\httplink{www.cyanogenmod.com}}{}{Assisted in development of CyanogenMod for Samsung Galaxy~S and Galaxy~S~II phones}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed voltage control, GPU clock control and other kernel features for Samsung Galaxy~S Captivate
    \item Developed boot script and makefile modifications to allow rootfs to be attached to prebuilt kernel and loaded by a bootstrap root built into the kernel
    \item Developed alternative calibration for Captivate geomagnetic sensor, eventually abandoned when proprietary calibration was made to work
    \item Adapted Nexus~S media codec library to interface correctly with kernel driver on Galaxy~S phones
    \item Modified vold to support management of mountpoints which are subdirectories of other mountpoints, including mounting and unmounting in correct order as needed
    \item Provided support in libhardware for loading wrapper modules that control access to proprietary vendor modules and can modify arguments and results of calls to the vendor module
    \item Ported modifications to radio interface class needed for proper radio function on US Samsung Galaxy~S~III models
\end{itemize}
\cventry{2008--current}{Software Developer}{audiomangler}{\httplink{github.com/Unhelpful/audiomangler}}{}{Developed a Python module and utilities to drive command-line tools performing common operations on audio files}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and developed driver for command-line tools, initially using Python standard library subprocess module, later reimplemented using Twisted (\httplink{twistedmatrix.com})
    \item Developed text templating module supporting specialized text formatting functions and arbitrary inline Python expressions
    \item Developed scripts using the provided library functions to rename audio files with names generated from tags, convert audio files between formats and generate ReplayGain information and insert it into audio file tags
\end{itemize}
\cventry{2008--2010}{Volunteer Software Developer}{Rockbox}{\httplink{www.rockbox.org}}{}{Developed features for an alternative firmware for Digital Audio Players}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added support for on-demand scaling of cover art bitmap files
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed low-memory, low-complexity linear image scaler with pluggable output format for core firmware
        \item Integrated core firmware bitmap loader and image scaler into plugin library and adapted existing plugins to use new loader/scaler
        \item Reduced memory footprint for image dithering in loader/scaler
    \end{itemize}
    \item Added initialization of plugin library pointer to plugin loader, removing code from each plugin to initialize the library pointer
    \item Improved PictureFlow album cover visualization plugin
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed buffer library to manage cache of album covers in memory
        \item Rewrote software rasterizer to render covers with correct 3D projection
        \item Created input schemes for different targets to provide consistent control
        \item Updated Rockbox manual to reflect changes in PictureFlow plugin input
    \end{itemize}
    \item Added support for JPEG cover art
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modified IJG JPEG decoder to build as part of Rockbox firmware and to function as an image source for the image scaler
        \item Developed optimized assembly JPEG IDCT routines for ARMv4, ARMv5, ARMv5 architectures
    \end{itemize}
    \item Developed and tested optimized Newton-Raphson reciprocal divider for ARM processors
    \item Developed specialized divider variant for use by Monkey's Audio codec, using a reciprocal lookup table for small divisors
\end{itemize}
